Only supporting from IOS 8 and futher. Is capable of installing on IOS 7, but no crashes are not guarenteed!

Pull in Xcode!


##VoiceOver
When enabling voice over, the first element will be the categorytypeview. This is necessary, otherwise the carousel scroll does not work.
- The scroll will work with three fingers left and right
- Opening a message is done with double tapping

Inside the message, the user has to swipe with one finger to go to another element
- To scroll inside the textView, it is necessary to dubble tap the view and hold (three fingers not working at this moment)
- Closing is done with three fingers sliding to the left, inside the messagecontent or outside the messagecontent (not at the title!)

When the user returns to the Carousel, the user will have to swipe to the right one time so the highlighted element will be the categorytypeview again. It is also possible to tick the categorytypeview at once. When done, the user can scroll with three fingers again.
